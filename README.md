### üß™ Demo & Community Testing Mode (Auto-Login)

#### What is Auto-Login?
For hackathon/demo purposes, ISpaniBot supports a special auto-login mode that allows anyone with the app link to instantly access and test the platform‚Äîno registration or sign-in required. This is perfect for sharing your app on platforms like Padlet for community voting and feedback.

#### How It Works
- On app load, the frontend automatically calls a Supabase Edge Function (`auto-login`) that returns a valid session.
- The session is stored in localStorage and injected into Supabase Auth, bypassing the login page entirely.
- Users are redirected straight to the dashboard and can use all app features as a demo user.
- The login page is never shown while auto-login is active.

#### Edge Function Details
- **URL:** `https://uufbuatrnoprynesbirw.supabase.co/functions/v1/auto-login`
- **Response Format:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Auto-login successful",
    "session": {
      "access_token": "...",
      "refresh_token": "...",
      "expires_at": 1234567890,
      "user": { ... }
    },
    "user": { ... }
  }
  ```
- **Integration:** See `src/lib/autoLogin.ts` and `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` for implementation details.

#### How to Share for Community Testing
1. **Deploy your app** (e.g., on Bolt.new, Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
2. **Share the deployed link** on Padlet or other platforms.
3. **Anyone with the link** will be auto-logged in and can test the app immediately‚Äîno sign up required!

#### Disabling Auto-Login (for production)
To revert to normal authentication, simply remove or comment out the auto-login logic in `AuthContext.tsx` and remove the `autoLogin` utility import. This will restore the standard sign up/sign in flow.
